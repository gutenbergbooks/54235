<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span>
little work now offered to the public
was originally compiled by Mr. Ritson about
the same period as similar treatises, on <i>The Office
of Constable</i>, and <i>The Jurisdiction of the Court-Leet</i>,
published in his lifetime. The author's
attachment to the subject, it is believed, induced
him to defer the publication of the present digest,
in the hope of increasing its value by ampler
information or more diligent research; and this
object appears to have been sufficiently pursued,
during the latter years of the author's life, to
answer his wishes, as the work was left by him
in every respect ready for the press.</p>

<p>The editor feels it due to the memory of his
much honored and lamented uncle to add, that
the recent publications to which Mr. Ritson's
name, from interested motives, has been, very
unwarrantably, affixed, are not intitled to any
credit.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span>
subject of the following digest is not, as may
be hastily imagined, a matter of mere curiosity
or antiquarian research. The officer of whom it treats
exercises his function in many parts of the kingdom,
in its fullest extent, at this day; though the attention
requisite in certain branches of his duty may in some
places, no doubt, have induced him to neglect them.</p>

<p>The want of such a compilation as the present
must have been more or less felt by every one who
has acted in the execution of this office; and indeed
it ought to seem much more extraordinary (considering
the multitude of similar publications on other subjects)
that it should not have been attempted long
ago, than that it appears at present.</p>

<p>Little can, and less need be said in favour of a
work which has no obligations either to genius or
to judgement: some labour, however, has undoubtedly
been exerted in the compilation, which, should it have
the good fortune to prove so far serviceable to those
whom it most concerns, as to render the discharge of
an ancient and honorable office an object of less
difficulty or hazard, the 'compiler' will not have reason
to regret.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Bailiff</span>
(<i>Baillif</i>, or <i>Baillie</i> French; <i>Ballivus</i>,
Latin; from <i>balliare</i> to deliver, intrust, or commit,)
is the name given by the Normans to those
ministers of the law whom the Saxons called <span class="anglosaxon">gerefa</span>,
<i>greve</i> or <i>reve</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>:
an appellation which, however corruptly,
we still retain in the word <i>sheriff</i>, (<span class="anglosaxon">scyre-gerefa</span>,
or <i>shire-reve</i>,) and by which the bailiff of a manor
is in many parts of the kingdom known to this day.
The sheriff himself did not, it is true, long continue
to enjoy the title of bailiff, which gave place to the
more honorable one of <i>vicecomes</i> or <i>viscount</i> (<i>qui fungitur
vice comitis</i>,) by which name alone he was constantly
stiled in all judicial proceedings, till the progressive
ascendency of the English tongue restored to
him his ancient and original appellation. His county,
however, is still called his <i>bailiwick</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>,
he is often mentioned in <i>Magna Charta</i> and ancient statutes along
with <i>alii ballivi</i>, and is himself frequently included
under that title<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>.
Between this officer and the bailiff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">{xii}</a></span>
of a hundred, manor or liberty, such a perfect resemblance
appears to have subsisted, in all respects, that
there cannot be a doubt that both were the produce,
if not of the same hand, at least, of the same system.
The division of the kingdom into counties, hundreds
and tithings, is well known to be owing to the wise
policy of the great Ælfred<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>;
each county, hundred or
tithing is agreed to have been subjected to an officer
known by the common name of the <span class="anglosaxon">gerefa</span>; he who
presided over the county at large being usually, by
way of distinction, called the <span class="anglosaxon">heh</span> or
<span class="anglosaxon">scyre-gerefa</span> and
sometimes the <span class="anglosaxon">scyr</span>-man, as the others were stiled
the <span class="anglosaxon">hundred</span> and <span class="anglosaxon">tything-gerefa</span>
or the hundreder, and tithingman<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>.
We are but imperfectly acquainted with
the duty of this officer till after the conquest. It is
said, indeed, that the sheriff, in the time of the Saxons,
was not the minister of the King, but the officer
of the <span class="anglosaxon">Ealderman</span> or <span class="anglosaxon">Eorl</span><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>.
And what this alderman
or earl was to the county, the lord or thain was, no
doubt, to his manor or liberty, and what the sheriff
was to the former, the inferior <span class="anglosaxon">gerefa</span> or bailiff was
to the latter. Certain it is that not only the several
courts of which we shall have occasion to speak, but
what we now call manors or liberties, existed from a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>
early period, nor was it possible for the Norman Kings
to enlarge, in favour of their own countrymen, the
amazing powers which almost every petty Saxon thain
or lord exercised in his jurisdiction, either from the
nature of the constitution and ordinary course of law,
or the liberal grants of the Saxon monarchs: powers
which the Norman jurists never found themselves able
to express in a different language<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>.</p>

<p>The sheriff was originally elected by the freeholders
or suitors of the great Court Baron of the county,
commonly called the County Court; the bailiff by the
freeholders of the hundred or manor, suitors to the
Court Baron of each division<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>:
and when the right of
election in the former case was wrested from the
people by the Norman tyrants<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>,
the same right in the
latter case was usurped by the lord of the hundred or
manor. The sheriff presided as judge in the folkmote
or leet of the county, the bailiff in that of the
hundred or manor. The former sat as principal executive
officer of the County Court; the bailiff, of the
Court Baron; the freeholders or suitors being the judges
in each to this day: and though both seem to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span>
anciently considered as the Kings courts, yet offences
were in one alledged to be <i>contra pacem ballivi</i>, and in
the other <i>contra pacem vicecomitis</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>.
The fines and amerciaments
imposed in these courts were levied, and the
process of the court executed by the sheriff and bailiff
in the same manner; each having his serjeants or inferior
officers to assist him: and in the proceedings of
the above courts, or others nearly similar, and held by
or before the same persons, was comprehended the
whole system, as well of the civil as of the criminal
law of that age, not only before the institution of
judges itinerant, but (in many cases at least) long
after. The revenue of the crown was collected and accounted
for by the sheriff and bailiff within their respective
jurisdictions: And as each of them governed
the tenants in peace, so he led them forth to war when
necessity required<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>.
Each of them had likewise his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">{xv}</a></span>
proper <i>aid</i> or <i>scot</i>, which he assessed upon the landholders
within his bailiwick, who frequently complained
of it as an intolerable grievance, and as such
it was at length abolished. The Kings writ is thought
not to have run as it now does till about the institution
of the Eyre or Iter of the Justices by K. <i>H. 2</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
How his commands were signified before this invention
does not clearly appear<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span>;
but certainly after it took
place, the execution of the writ (though necessarily
directed to the sheriff) was as much the duty of the
bailiff within the franchise, as of the sheriff without;
nor could the latter, without a special authority, interfere
in the most trivial matter which belonged to
the other. In short, whatever the sheriff did or could
do in the county at large the bailiff could do and did
within his franchise, whether hundred<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
or manor. Such was the ancient constitution, and such in a great
measure will appear from the following sheets to be
the law at this day.</p>

<cite>Fleta. l. 2. c. 53.</cite> § 1. The <i>steward</i> has been in possession of this
branch of the bailiffs office for many centuries. When this transfer took
place would be scarcely possible to discover. It should seem, however, to
have been gradual, and might possibly have its rise from the <i>Senescallus</i>,
the <span class="anglosaxon">Styweard</span> or <i>major-domo</i> being sometimes more conversant in forensic
matters than the bailiff, whose office chiefly concerned the management
of the lords demesne and other out-of-door concerns. The <i>Mirror</i>
(written in the time of <i>E. 2.</i>) constantly speaks of the bailiff as judge of
the court leet; see also Ken. <cite>Par. Ant.</cite> p. 319. And thus Finch, speaking
of the County Court and Court Baron, says "the suitors are the judges
and the <i>bailiff</i> and sheriff are but ministers." <cite>Law.</cite> 248. And hence,
perhaps, it has been held that both offices might be enjoyed by one and
the same person. <cite>Cro. Jac.</cite> 178. (cites <i>29 H. 8.</i>) And it should seem
from Bracton that writs were indifferently directed to either the steward,
or the bailiff, <i>ballivo vel senescallo</i>. <cite>l. 5. c. 32.</cite></p>

<p>About the time that this separation took place, the lowest branches of
the bailiffs office were transfered to an inferior minister, named a <i>reve</i>, of
whom we read at large in <cite>Fleta. l. 2. c. 76.</cite> But possibly this was only
the case in extensive manors and demesnes, where a single person was
found unequal to the discharge of the united functions of <i>steward</i>, <i>bailiff</i>,
and <i>reve</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>OF THE LIBERTY OF <i>Retorna Brevium</i>, OR RETURN OF WRITS.</small></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Roll of Liberties.<br /><i>Non omittas.</i></div>
<p><span class="uppercase">By</span> <cite>W. 2. c. 39.</cite> The treasurer of the exchequer
shall deliver in a roll all the liberties in all shires that
have return of writs. And if the sheriff answer that
he hath made return to the bailiffs of any other liberty
than is contained in the said roll, the sheriff shall be
forthwith punished as a disheritor of the King and his crown<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>.
And if peradventure he answer that he hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
returned the writ to the bailiffs of some liberty that
indeed hath return who hath done nothing therein<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span>,
the sheriff shall be commanded that he shall not omit
by reason of the aforesaid liberty, but that the Kings
precept shall be executed; and that he make known to
the bailiffs to whom he returned the writ that they be
at a day contained in the writ to answer why they have
not made execution of the Kings precept. And if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
they come at the day and acquit themselves that return
of the writ was not made to them, the sheriff shall be
forthwith condemned to the lord of the same liberty,
and likewise the party grieved by the delay in restitution
of damages. And if the bailiffs come not at the
day, or come and do not acquit themselves in manner
aforesaid, in every judicial writ, so long as the plea
endureth, the sheriff shall be commanded that he omit
not because of the liberty, &amp;c.</p>

<p>That the statute, in this respect, was little more
than a declaration of the common law, appears from
<cite>Bracton. l. 5. c. 32.</cite></p>

<div class="sidenote">Indenture.</div>
<p>By <cite>12 E. 2. c. 5.</cite> Of returns which shall be made
to sheriffs by bailiffs of such franchises as have full return
of the Kings writs, an indenture shall be made
between the bailiff of the franchise by his proper name,
and the sheriff by his proper name. And if any sheriff
change the return so delivered to him by indenture,
and thereof be convicted at the suit of the lord of the
franchise, of whom he shall have received such return,
if the lord shall have sustained any damage, or his franchise
be imblemished, and at the suit of the party who
shall have sustained damage by that occasion, he shall
be punished on behalf of the King for his false return,
and render to the lord and to the party double damages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prescription.</div>
<p>Return of writs may be claimed by prescription as
appertaining to a manor. But more especially may it
be claimed as appertaining to an honour. <cite>Hardres.</cite> 423.</p>

comes to the hands of the King by escheat <i>vel aliter</i>,
this unity in the King shall not extinguish the liberty.

<div class="sidenote">A dangerous liberty!</div>
<p>This liberty of Retorna Brevium (saith C. B. Hale)
is a dangerous liberty for him that hath it; for he is
to be responsible for all the defaults of his bailiffs, as
escapes, &amp;c. And if the bailiff do not account for
the collection of the Kings revenue he is responsible
for it; 'tis a feather in his cap, but a thorn in his
foot. <cite>2 Vent.</cite> 406.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sheriff.</div>
<p>This liberty though it carries an exemption, yet it
doth not exclude, but that the sheriff may execute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
writs within it. But then it is a wrong for which
the lord of the liberty may have his action: but
in some cases the sheriff may lawfully do it, as in
the case of the King. A <i>non omittas</i>, <span class="amp">&amp;c.</span> in case
of execution of a writ of waste, whereto he is
particularly empowered by the statute, and sometimes
where the thing is divided<span

<div class="sidenote">Warrant.</div>
<p>If an action be brought in a county, and the place
where, <span class="amp">&amp;c.</span> is the franchise of another who hath return
and execution of writs within the said franchise, yet
the writ shall issue to the sheriff, and he ought to make
over a warrant to the bailiff of the franchise to execute
the same writ; and the writ shall not be directed
to the bailiff, &amp;c. for he is not officer to the court.
And moreover it shall be intended that all vills in the
county are within the power of the sheriff till the contrary
be made appear by return of the sheriff. <cite>35 H. 6. 42.</cite></p>

<p>To the sheriff the writ must be directed, though it
be for a thing done in a franchise, and he shall send to
a [<i>l.</i> the] bailiff of the franchise who shall serve it as a

<p>Where the sheriff makes execution in franchise it
is good, for he is immediate officer to the court;
otherwise where bailiff makes execution in the guildable;

have his remedy for infringing the franchise. <cite>11 H. 4. Br. Execution.</cite> 32.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Non omittas.</i></div>
<p>In the county of Suffolk are two liberties, one
of St. Edmund Bury, and the other of St. Ethelred
of Ely: suppose a <i>capias</i> comes at the suit of <i>A.</i> to
the sheriff of Suffolk, to arrest the body of <i>B.</i> the
sheriff makes a mandate to the bailiff of the liberty of
St. Ethelred, who makes no answer; in that case the
plaintiff shall have a writ of <i>non omittas</i>, and by
force thereof he may arrest the defendant within the
liberty of Bury, although no default was in him [<i>sci.</i>
in the bailiff of that liberty.] <cite>5 Rep.</cite> 92.</p>

<p>But this is to be understood of the process of the
Kings Bench; for Common Pleas recites the <i>capias</i>,
the sheriffs return, that he has made his mandate to
the bailiff, who has given no answer, and then gives
the sheriff power to enter the liberty; but in the
Kings Bench, on the sheriffs return on the <i>Latitat</i>,
the authority is general, <i>non omittas propter aliquam
libertatem</i>, which gives the sheriff power to enter not
only that liberty, but all the liberties within the county:
And this seems to be grounded on the words of the
<i>latitat</i>, (viz.) <i>latitat</i> and <i>discurrit</i>, so that the defendant
is supposed to skulk and run from one place to
another; and therefore the <i>non omittas</i> was made general,
that he might not run from one liberty to
another. <cite>Gilb. Hist. C. P.</cite> 24.<span

<p><i>Note</i>, If any of your defendants live within a liberty
where the sheriff may not enter, you must get
the sheriff to direct his warrant on your writ to the
bailiff of such liberty, who may execute it; but if
the bailiff of such liberty do not execute it, then you
must at the return of your writ, get the sheriff to return
a <i>mandavi ballivo</i> thereon, and thereupon you make
out a writ called a <i>non omittas</i>, directed to the sheriff,
and upon that writ the sheriffs officers may, upon
the sheriffs warrant made out thereon, enter and
execute the warrant within such liberty. <cite>1 Instructor

<p>Bill to establish plaintiffs right to the manor, &amp;c. of
Sherborn Castleton in the county of Dorset, to Greenwax
fines, &amp;c., and also poundage fees on executions
and <i>Retorna Brevium</i>, &amp;c. by virtue of a grant 14
Jac. 1. The bill was brought against three succeeding
sheriffs of the county, and Templeman, who had been
the undersheriff for three or four years, and as to
him to have an account of what poundage fees, &amp;c.
he had received within the liberty: the title set forth
by plaintiff was, that King James I. granted to Sir
John Digby (after earl of Bristol), from him they descended
to George, from him to John earl of Bristol,
<i>and on his death vested in plaintiff</i>.</p>

<p>It was objected at the hearing that here was not a
sufficient title set forth, it not appearing how the premises
vested in plaintiff, whether by descent, settlement,
or how.</p>

<p>And <i>per tot' cur'</i> the bill ought to be dismissed for
that reason; the bill being to establish a right, as well
as for an account; and upon this the cause went off,
but plaintiff had liberty to amend his bill. <cite>Hanbury</cite>, 195.</p>

In the Kings Bench the sheriff returned <i>Mand' ballivo' Libertatis de D.</i>
and it was said that he hath not such a franchise, and if it be inrolled in
the chancery that A. hath <i>retorna brevium</i>, yet if it be not inrolled in the
exchequer, as the statute of <cite>W. 2. c. 39.</cite> and if the sheriff return other
liberty he shall be punished as a disinheritor of the Crown by such statute,
and the justices may send <i>certiorari</i> out of chancery to the treasurer, that
he bring the roll of liberties in his hand, and shew it to the justices. <cite>11 E. 4. 4.</cite>
<cite>Br. Retorne de briefe.</cite> 98.</p>

<p>This Roll of Liberties is supposed to be lost; at least the clerks of the

mentioned by Powell to be in the <i>Kings Remembrancers office</i>, "intituled,

<p><i>Per Curiam</i>, where the bailiff makes insufficient return, the sheriff
may return <i>quod nullum dedit responsum</i>, for an insufficient return is as no

shall be amerceo, but by <i>Vavisour</i> if the bailiff make dubious return and
the sheriff return it over he shall not be amerced, <i>quære</i>. <cite>5 H. 7. 27.</cite>

<p>In <i>Præcipe quod reddat</i>, to the grand capias the sheriff returned <i>quod

the hands of the King, and says nothing that he hath summoned the tenant.
<i>Martin</i>, another summons with <i>non omittas</i> shall be awarded, and the
sheriff shall not be amerced, for the bailiff hath not served the writ;
for as much as he had in commandment to do two things, and he has done
but one; and so it is as if he had said nothing either of one or the other.
<cite>Babb</cite>, a <i>non omittas</i> shall not be awarded but where the bailiff hath not
given any return, but here he hath given a return which is not sufficient,
and for this he shall be amerced. <cite>T. 4 H. 6. [25.]</cite> <cite>Fitz. Amercement.</cite> 1.</p>

<p>In trespass the sheriff returned the <i>Capias quod mandavit Ballivo Libertatis,

the body; but the defendant would have answered by attorney, and was
not received. And the plaintiff prayed <i>Sicut alias</i> to the sheriff, and

but a writ to the sheriff to distrain the bailiff to send the body, &amp;c.

<p>When the King grants any privileges, liberties, franchises, &amp;c. which

And so the court thought. <cite>H. 18. E. 3.</cite> <i>quære</i>, how the writ shall be

In the <cite>Auctarium Additamentorum</cite> to Watts's edition of Matthew
Paris is a warrant from the sheriff of Essex and Hertford to the bailiffs
of the liberty of St. Albans, reciting a writ to the sheriff to summon the
knights and freeholders of the said counties, &amp;c. to be before the Kings commissioner
with an express <i>non omittas</i> in case of the default of the bailiffs
of liberties; which proves that the writ for the King was not at that time
(37 H. 3.) a <i>non omittas</i> of itself.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_25" id="Foot_25" href="#Ref_25">[25]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It seems that the sheriff ought to take notice of such a liberty at
his peril, without the party shewing his grant to him but merely upon
his saying that he hath one, because it is a matter of record. <cite>1 Roll R.</cite>

Rule to shew cause why a writ of <i>non omittas capias ad respondendum</i>,
should not be quashed, discharged. The objection to the writ was, that
it recited a mandate to have been issued forth by the sheriff to the
bailiff of a liberty without naming what liberty, but leaving a blank for
the same. The court held the objection to be valid, and that the proper
way to take advantage of the defect is by motion; but it appearing that
bail was put in to this writ before a judge, the objection now comes too
late. <cite>Barnes.</cite> 416.</p>

Where the sheriff serves the process once of a thing local or permanent,
as in <i>Præcipe</i> of land and such like, he cannot after return
<i>mandavi ballivo</i>; but <i>e contra</i> of a thing transitory which may remove.
<cite>5 H. 7. 27.</cite> <cite>Br. Ret. de briefe.</cite> 89.</p>

<p>Thus in <i>Alias Summons</i> in Dower the sheriff can't return <i>mandavi
ballivo</i>, for he ought to have made this return upon the first writ, that
so the court might have awarded a <i>non omittas</i>; but if it relates to
matters transitory, then the sheriff may return <i>mandavi ballivo</i>
on the issuing of the second process, as on an <i>alias capias</i>, for the
body might be in the liberty on the issuing of the second process, though
it was in the guildable in the first; and therefore the return of the first
process does not conclude him from returning the liberty to the second
process. <cite>Gilb. Hist. C. P.</cite> 26.</p>

<i>Urlin</i> moved to stay proceedings, the process being served within the
franchise of Bury St. Edmonds, and not by the proper officer, contrary
to the late act of parliament. <i>Per Cur'</i>: The act only preserves and
saves the jurisdiction of particular liberties. The person injured must
bring his action, the court cannot stay proceedings. <cite>Barns.</cite> 404.</p>

How far such a practice is consistent with the rights of the lord of
the liberty or with the law of the land (and particularly with the act just
above recited) is submitted to those whose duty it is to support both.</p>

<p>In Yorkshire it is usual for the sheriff to direct the warrant as well
to the bailiff of the liberty as to one or more of his own bailiffs, who may
take defendant if found <i>extra libertatem</i>. This method is unobjectionable,
it prevents delay and answers all the purposes of a <i>non omittas</i>.</p>

It is an old rule of the duchy court that the bailiffs of the liberties
of the duchy may distrain for fines and amerciaments for the King, and
keep the same fifteen days, and if the party distrained refuse to pay
his fine or amerciament, then the bailiff may sell the same, unless the
party distrained will enter into bond to pay the said fine or amerciament
at a day prefixed in the duchy court, or else shew good cause; but in
this case there is no replevy to be granted against the King. And all
this it seemeth the bailiff shall do <i>ex officio</i>. The fines and amerciaments
within the liberties of the duchy are, however, usually levyed
by writ of <i>levari facias <span class="amp">&amp;</span> capias</i> out of the duchy court. And,</p>

<p>By Keble, precept to bailiff by nude parol is as effectual in court <i>Baron</i>

<i>Per</i> Levinz serjeant. In fact the sheriffs make no warrants to the
bailiffs of liberties, but they only send the writ to them; and they
execute it upon some general warrant, which they have from the sheriffs
to execute all writs according to the agreement between the sheriffs and
bailiffs. But (<i>per curiam</i>) this general warrant serves for a warrant to
every particular case, for there must be a warrant in writing, because
a command by parol to the bailiff of a liberty is not sufficient,

to the court, yet no action for this false return
lies against the old bailiff, for the return ought
to be made in the name of the new bailiff, and so the
sheriff has accepted a return as of a mere stranger,

<div class="sidenote">Escape from gaoler<br />
of liberty.</div>
<p>An attachment of contempt issued forth against defendant,
for not bringing Waldrons body into court,
pursuant to a peremptory rule; and defendant having
been examined upon interrogatories, it was referred to
the prothonotary (as usual) to examine whether he
had cleared himself of the contempt, or not. The
prothonotary reported the matter specially; and the
fact appeared to the court to be, that Waldron being
confined in the Gatehouse prison, Westminster, for a
criminal matter, was, by leave of a judge, charged
there with a bailable action, in the following manner:
A <i>capias ad respondendum</i> was directed to the sheriff of
Middlesex, who made a <i>mandate</i> to the high bailiff
of Westminster, and defendant was charged in custody
therewith, and afterwards escaped from the keeper of
the Gatehouse, which is the prison for the liberty of
Westminster, to which prison the high bailiff is obliged
to carry his prisoners within 24 hours after arrest.
The high bailiff being called upon for a return of the
<i>mandate</i>, returned <i>cepi corpus</i>, and that Waldron remained
in the custody of the keeper of the Gatehouse.
Both the chief bailiff and the keeper of the Gatehouse
are appointed by, and hold their places under, the
dean and chapter of Westminster, and both give security
to the dean and chapter; but the keeper gives no
security to the high bailiff. The Court were of opinion,
that the high bailiff had cleared himself of the contempt,
and ordered the attachment to be discharged.
The high bailiff did every thing in his power to secure
the prisoner, and ought not to be criminally punished.
<i>Respondeat superior</i> extends to civil matters only. The
prosecutor may bring his action for the escape. <i>Barnes</i>,

<p>J. S. was taken in execution by <i>Ca. Sa.</i> by the bailiffs
of a liberty in Suffolk, by warrant of the sheriff
of the county. The bailiffs before the return of the
<i>Ca. Sa.</i> brought him to Westminster in the county of
Middlesex, and from thence, at the plaintiffs request,
carried him to Lambeth in Surrey, where he remained
under their custody till the day of the return of the
writ, when they delivered him to the Kings Bench according
to the writ; this, by the advice of all the
justices, was adjudged no escape; for they thought
that in whatever county in the way or out of the way
to Westminster, the sheriff detains or brings the prisoner,
if it be before the return of the writ it is no
escape. <cite>Moore</cite>, 299. <cite>Burton</cite> [<i>Boyton</i>] v. <i>Andrews</i>.

<p>A warrant was from the sheriff to the bailiff of the

Debt upon bond by the plaintiff who was chief
bailiff of the liberty of Pontefract in Yorkshire, but
he did not declare as <i>capital' ballivus</i>, but yet by the
whole court it was held good; for otherwise the defendant
might have craved <i>oyer</i>, and have [had] it entered
<i>in hæc verba</i>, and then have pleaded the statute
of <i>23 H. 6.</i> that it was taken <i>colore officii</i>, but now
it shall be intended good upon the demurrer to
the declaration. And <i>Ellis, J.</i> said, that so it was
lately resolved in this court in the case of one Conquest.

<p>In case against a bailiff for the false return of <i>nulla

evidence at the trial, whether the bailiff of a liberty
shall be concluded in point of evidence by the return
of the sheriff? and <i>per curiam</i>, he is concluded; and
if the sheriff makes any other return than that which
the bailiff makes to him, he may have his action against
the sheriff; and it was said that Holt, chief justice,
was of this opinion. See <cite>36 Hen. 6. 40 [1.]</cite> <cite>L.

The 'compiler' not finding an example of this indenture in any
book, has been tempted to frame something resembling what he conceives
it has been. It is, however, more for curiosity than use, as the bailiff
seems completely deprived of the benefit of the statute by the modern
stamp acts. The effect may nevertheless be attained by a simple memorandum
as follows: <small>BE IT REMEMBERED</small>, that <i>J. K.</i> esquire, bailiff
<span class="amp">&amp;c.</span> hath certifyed and returned unto <i>F. G.</i> and <i>H. I.</i> sheriff, <span class="amp">&amp;c.</span> that by

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
